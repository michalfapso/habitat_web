## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository settings under Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions for the deployment to work:

   * FTP_SERVER
   * FTP_USERNAME
   * FTP_PASSWORD
   * SMTP_HOST
   * SMTP_USERNAME
   * SMTP_PASSWORD
   * EMAIL_RECIPIENT
   * ECOMAIL_API_KEY
   * ECOMAIL_LIST_ID

Once you've added these secrets, the next time you push a commit to your main branch, the GitHub Action will automatically build your Astro site, install the PHP dependencies, generate the config.php file with your secrets, and deploy everything to your FTP server.
